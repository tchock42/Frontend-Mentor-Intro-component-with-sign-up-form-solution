## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### Screenshot

Here is a screenshot of the website I made. I found this project challenging and fun because it has some field to be validated.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project I continue learning about validating forms and javascript. I think this kind of exercises reinforce my knowledge about javascript.


### Continued development

In the next projects I hope I could use gulp and npm elements to make easier the process of development. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.stechies.com/) - This site help me to validate the email field. In other frontmentor challenge I only serch for @ and dot, but now I find the place and order of this characters
